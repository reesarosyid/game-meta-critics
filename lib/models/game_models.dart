    name: "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom",
    synopsis: "Tears of the Kingdom takes place several years after Breath of the Wild, at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.[6] Link and Zelda set out to explore a cavern beneath Hyrule Castle, from which a poisonous substance called gloom has been seeping out and causing people to fall ill. There, they find a mural depicting the founding of Hyrule and a conflict known as the Imprisoning War—an ancient battle against a being referred to as the 'Demon King'—and decide to venture deeper, triggering the awakening of a mummy who attacks the two with gloom. As a result, Link's right arm is badly damaged, the Master Sword is shattered, and Hyrule Castle is raised upwards. Zelda falls below, and as Link tries to catch her, she vanishes with a mysterious artifact. Link is rescued by a disembodied arm, which had been restraining the mummy, and he awakens on the Great Sky Island to find that it has replaced his damaged arm. He meets the spirit of Rauru, a Zonai who is the source of his new arm. Rauru assists Link as he traverses the Great Sky Island, and once Link reaches his destination, the shattered Master Sword vanishes and he dives to the surface below. There, he learns that the event in the cavern, known as the Upheaval, has wrought chaos upon Hyrule, and sets out to investigate reports of strange phenomena occurring throughout the kingdom. In the process, he reunites with Sidon, the prince and later king of the Zora; Tulin, a young Rito archer and the son of Teba, a past ally of Link's; Yunobo, a Goron and the president of YunoboCo, a mining company; and Riju, the chief of the Gerudo. Alongside them, Link ventures into ancient Zonai temples and defeats the monsters occupying them. As he does so, he finds strange artifacts and the spirits of sages from ancient times appear to him and his allies. They appoint his companions as sages and pass down the artifacts, secret stones, which they once wielded. Afterwards, after reports of Zelda's appearance across Hyrule, Link tracks her down to Hyrule Castle, where she reveals herself to be Phantom Ganon, a servant of the Demon King, Ganondorf, who was the mummy beneath Hyrule Castle. Phantom Ganon is defeated by Link and his allies, and Link later encounters Mineru, an ancient sage who remains in the physical world via spiritual projection. He helps create a mechanical body for her spirit to inhabit. Through Mineru, the other ancient sages, and Dragon's Tears scattered throughout the land, Link learns of Zelda's fate. The artifact that vanished with her was a secret stone, and with it, she was transported through time to the distant past. There, she met Rauru, Hyrule's first king, and Sonia, Hyrule's first queen. In the past, after faking fealty to Rauru, Ganondorf killed Sonia, stealing her secret stone and using it to become the Demon King. Rauru appointed Mineru, Zelda, and the leaders of the Zora, Rito, Gorons, and Gerudo as sages, and, with the sages' aid, sacrificed himself to seal away Ganondorf. Later, Zelda received the Master Sword and tasked the sages with aiding Link in the future. To restore the Master Sword and bring it to Link, she swallowed her secret stone and underwent a process known as draconification, becoming the Light Dragon. In the present, after ridding the Great Deku Tree of gloom in Korok Forest, Link retrieves the Master Sword from the Light Dragon and goes to confront Ganondorf below Hyrule Castle. With aid from Sidon, Tulin, Yunobo, Riju, and Mineru, Link battles an army of monsters before engaging in combat with Ganondorf. Nearing defeat, Ganondorf swallows his secret stone and becomes the Demon Dragon, who engages Link in combat in the skies above Hyrule. With the assistance of the Light Dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the Demon Dragon's secret stone, killing it. Aided by the spirits of Rauru and Sonia, Link is able to turn Zelda back to normal and regains his original right arm. Rauru and Sonia fade away, and Link and Zelda fall to the surface below, where they reunite.",
